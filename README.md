# Introduction
This is a very basic Phone-Book which can store the first name and the phone number of a person. It uses Linked List data structure to store the data and then perform various operations on it such as:

Deleting a contact.
Sorting them alphabetically.
adding new contacts.
Searching a contact.
Saving the changes to the file Phone-Book.txt.

### Windows
Simply compile and run the program as follows:
```
$ gcc main.c load.c phonebook.c -o phonebook
$ ./phonebook
```

select the option '1' to display all the contacts in "**_Phone-Book.txt_**" file. Notice that these are just example values which can be altered.
